# Setting Up Libraries
I will mainly be using tidyr and dplyr here to do the analysis.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr) 
#library(stringr)
```

# Analysis Questions
Thanks to *Deepa Sharma* for the analysis questions:   
1- What is the highest-rated TV show of each year?   
2- What is the highest rated TV show from each category in the data set?   
   
   For the first question, I will have to use tidyr to separate the "year" column, as it is includes the start year and end year of each show separated by a dash. I will assume the question asks for the highest rated TV show per release year. For the second question, I will assume that "category" refers to the genre column, which will also require separation as each cell of that column contains several genres that the show might fall into.
